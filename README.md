### C standard library functions reinventedðŸ¤“

### Important note
This was my schools first project, I started writing it with 0 knowledge of C or any other programming language what so ever.
Some of the function implementations are over complicated or just plain unefficent. I have decided to leave them as is since,
they are a nice point of reference to where I started vs where I am now.
